# ket

**K**rathalan's **e**xposure **t**racker, or ket, is a program for radiologic technologists to keep track of your repeat rates.

Run `ket new` to make a new entry. When asked to provide an exam name, keep it as a one-word consistent identifier for each exam, e.g. "chest", "lumbar", etc. Same for repeat reason, e.g. "artifact", "centering", "aec-sid".

Run `ket analyze` to get repeat rates. As of now, ket will analyze your repeat rates by patient type and day of week.
